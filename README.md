# UnityAutoSceneLoader
When dealing with multiple scenes in the Unity game engine's Editor, this script allows you to open one or more scenes, either when opening any existing scene or creating a new one. This helps speed up the development process by reducing the need for manual opening of scenes.
Modify the value of (scenePath) to suit your project's structure, and then add the names of the scenes you always want to open in (scene).
